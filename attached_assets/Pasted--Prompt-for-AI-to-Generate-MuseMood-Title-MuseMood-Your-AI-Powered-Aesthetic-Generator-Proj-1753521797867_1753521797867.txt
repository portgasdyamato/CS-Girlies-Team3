🧠 Prompt for AI to Generate MuseMood
Title: MuseMood – Your AI-Powered Aesthetic Generator

📘 Project Description:
MuseMood is a girly, vibe-based AI aesthetic generator that turns your emotions into a full sensory experience — a digital journal + outfit + moodboard + poem + playlist + persona — all based on your selected vibe or emotion.

🎯 Goal:
Allow users to select their mood, and based on that:

Write a journal entry under that mood

Auto-generate:

Aesthetic outfit (AI image + text)

Visual moodboard

Poem or quote

Curated Spotify playlist

Optional: a digital persona (fictional character)

🧭 User Flow:
Landing Page:

CTA: "Start Your Mood Journey"

Mood Selection:

Emoji + text input (e.g., “sad baddie”, “soft girl in Paris”)

Pastel UI with animations and glowing buttons

Journal Entry:

Prompted to write a diary-style entry under that selected mood

Textbox with soft background and mood-linked tone

AI Magic Begins:
After journal is submitted, generate:

🖼️ Moodboard: collage via Stable Diffusion

📜 Poem/Quote: GPT-powered poetic text in stylized font

🎵 Playlist: Spotify API curated playlist based on mood (vibe name + emojis)

👑 Optional Persona: fictional girlboss/fairycore-type avatar with bio

Output Page:

Each module shown in a pastel animated card

Downloadable/shareable outputs (outfit, board, quote)
